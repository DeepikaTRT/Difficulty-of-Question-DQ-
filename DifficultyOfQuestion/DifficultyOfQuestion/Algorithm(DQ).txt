Algorithm and code to find the difficulty of a question
The difficulty can be calculated based on the following factors:
# Manually assigned difficulty
# Total number of students who have attended the question 
# Time taken by each student to answer the question
# Number of times the answer was changed if it is MCQ type question
# Number of times the program was compiled if it is programming question
# Number of hints used -- Feedback given for this question by other students
# Total number of students who have answered it right
# Total number of students who have answered it wrong 
# Total number of students who have answered it partially correct 
# Maximum marks allocated for this question


To Store the arraylist of values new hashmap is created that contain the process of time taken, number of changes or compilations and number of hints of each student.

Using hashmap the total values of time taken, number of changes or compilations and number of hints are calculated.

Obtain the average values for same.

Thus the Process takes place.

Then the factor is calculated to assign based on difficulty of Question as follows:
   
    
         Difficulty that is assigned manually is calculated based on the manually assigned difficulty either it is Easy, Medium or Hard,then the difficulty is provided.In an arrayList the difficulty is to be added.
  Based on the type of question as MCQ(includes fillup and match the following) or Programming and also taking manually assigned difficulty into consideration, few values are set and if the average time breaches these values, difficulty is set based on that.The difficulty is added to the arraylist.  
  Count of changes or compilations are based on the type of question as MCQ(includes fillup and match the following) or Programming and also taking manually assigned difficulty into consideration few values are set and if the average number of changes or compilations breaches the values, difficulty is set based on that.The it is added to the arraylist.
  Total number of hints are assigned and also based on the manually assigned difficulty,and a range  for indicating each type of difficulty. 
  Then it is added to the arraylist.
  The number of hints is taken and the range of the difficulty is set based on some specific values taking manually assigned difficulty into consideration. The type difficulty is then added to the arraylist.
  Another difficulty is set based on the feedback given by other students to this particular question(easy/medium/hard). This difficulty is alse added to the arraylist.
  The overall marks of the question is calculated by multiplying total students who attended the question and the maximum marks provided as input. Marks of the student are calculated by multiplying the number of students who got it right with maximum marks and number of students who got it partially right with half of maximum marks. The difficulty is calculated by checking where the students marks lie in the division of the total marks by 3. The difficulty is added to the arraylist.
  The overall difficulty of the question is calculated by taking the arraylist frequency of each difficulty.

  The difficulty of the question is then printed.
